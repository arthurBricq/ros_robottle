# ROS for Robottle

This repo contains the ROS source code to run the project, that was writen by myself.

## Missing code for runtime

Some packages are not inserted, because I didn't write them and it makes no sense to put a lot of code in this github

- ros_deep_learning: this is the ROS package for CUDA realtime accelerated neuron network. I have just set it up, I still have a lot to do with this package, so far it is not needed on this git repo.
